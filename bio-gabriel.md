**Why is History the Science of the present?**
> I strongly believe that no matter how much technology, algorithms we get our hands on, it will not be matched to understanding our History. I will give this example: indeed having social media platforms gives us an unmeasurable reach to the world. Nowadays the U.S. has a lied-founded narrative about the origins of the Panama Canal. These messages are spreading rapidly among republican and like-minded citizens in the globe. Nonetheless, the true History and facts about the Canal can be easily debunked using data and books. What History advocates have to do is to properly use the technology to outmatch the former lies. That's why History is very relevant nowadays in the misinformation era.
